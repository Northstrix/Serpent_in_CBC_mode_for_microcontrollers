# Serpent_in_CBC_mode_for_microcontrollers

This repository contains code that enables you to easily integrate the Serpent encryption algorithm in CBC mode to your project.


## Compatibility

The code was successfully tested on the following boards:
- STM32F407VET6
- Teensy 4.1
- ESP32
- ESP8266


## Usage


```
  Serial.println("\nEncryption/Decryption Test:");
  String plaintext = "This string is encrypted with Serpent in Cipher Block Chaining mode!"; // String to be encrypted
  int iv[16]; // Initialization vector
  for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++){
    iv[i] = random(256); // Fill iv array with random numbers. I suggest you use a more secure method of random number generation!!!
  }
  encrypt_string_with_serpent_in_cbc(plaintext, iv); // Function for encryption. Takes the plaintext and iv as the input.
  Serial.println("\nCiphertext");
  Serial.println(string_for_data);
  String ciphertext = string_for_data; // Back the ciphertext up
  decrypt_string_with_serpent_in_cbc(ciphertext); // Decrypt data
  Serial.println("Plaintext:");
  Serial.println(string_for_data);
```
